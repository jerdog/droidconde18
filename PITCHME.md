### Lifecycle of Communities
@ul
- Inception @note[In the **INCEPTION** phase, you'll be inviting members to join, starting discussions and get participation in them, and build the relationships needed to make the community viable.]
- Establishment @note[When your community becomes **ESTABLISHED** you'll be writing content, organizing events, talks, etc., analyzing statistics about the community, deal with conflicts/disputes, etc.]
- Maturity @note[Community **MATURITY** will see the influence of the community growing, volunteers growing; goals and vision will be streamlined, refined, and widely adopted.]
- Mitosis @note[**MITOSIS** is when a cell splits into new nuclei - or in this case forms more-focused sub groups in your community. Communities can be thought of as organisms. Organisms are born, they grow, they mature, and then some split and replicate themselves elsewhere. But there's another aspect of communities that isn't often talked about - sometimes they die.]
- Death @note[The four cycles above are \natural, and if they aren't doing this, they're already dead - and with communities it is a real thing - and so I am adding **DEATH**.]

Note:
Feverbee, a community-consulting company, has come up with 4 stages in a community's lifecycle, with each having their own steps and/or tasks to get to the next stage.

## How do you get people involved?
"If you can *enable* an environment in which people can share, they will and the benefits will entice others to join." -**Susannah Fox**, *Pew Internet / American Life Project*

- Connection with others in community
- Belonging
@ulend

Note:
It is important to understand the different reasons that people participate in communities. A few of the different ways are:

Understanding why people would want to participate in your community is essential, but it is not enough to stop there - you must provide incentives for them to participate and move through the different stages of participation.

### Increasing participation
@ul
- Recognition and status boost @note[Being **recognized** for the things people do within the community, or boosting their status (sometimes both)]
- Access to more info, tools, resources, etc. @note[giving more **tools**, resources, or information;]
- More capabilities and control @note[more **capabilities or control**;]
- Swag. Cool stuff. @note[and **swag** (I mean who doesn't like swag?) These are all are ways to bring about more participation. It's essential to figure out what works best for _your_ community - there isn't one size / fits all.]
